# EDA-for-Machine-Learning-Honors-Project

The project requires students to select a dataset, perform comprehensive data analysis including cleaning, exploration, and hypothesis testing, and then present their findings and insights in a professional report suitable for senior stakeholders. Upon successfully completing this project I will receive a course certificate with Honors


## Overview
This repository contains my data analysis project for the [Course Name] at [University/Platform]. The project involves selecting a dataset, performing comprehensive data analysis, and presenting findings in a professional report.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the raw and processed datasets
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks with data exploration and analysis
- `src/`: Python scripts for data cleaning and processing
- `report/`: Final report in PDF format
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` directory

## Dataset
[Brief description of your chosen dataset and its source]

## Analysis Steps
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature engineering
4. Hypothesis formulation and testing
5. Insights and findings

## Report
The final report can be found in the `report/` directory. It includes:
- Data set description
- Data exploration plan
- Data cleaning and feature engineering steps
- Key findings and insights
